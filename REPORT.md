*The initial 8000 ATOM budget was set to last for 3 months as per [Cosmoshub proposal 862](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/862). IBC Relayers on the Cosmoshub have applied optimized batching settings, which efficiently lead to an extended service period of a total of 6 months. 

As the initial grant has now depleted, the Cosmoshub Relayer Feegrant Workinggroup is now seeking to request another batch of intermediary tx fee compensation in form of a grant from the [Atom Accelerator DAO](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xDrPdqDh6bZvoSS2s3VPlWfvTvVjALBY2Ds10eCNkL8/edit?gid=0#gid=0).
