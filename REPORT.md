Following the depletion of the initial community pool grant set forth in [Cosmoshub proposal 862](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/862), Cosmoshub IBC Relayer operators have requested [a grant from the Atom Accelerator DAO](https://www.atomaccelerator.com/202409-grant-spotlight-ensuring-seamless-ibc-on-the-hub-with-ibc-relayers-wg), which was approved in July 2024. The total grant sum of 8445.862 ATOM is estimated to sustain IBC relayer transaction fees for at least 6 months.

## RELAYER FEEGRANT WG - Report 1/2024

Timeframe: 2024/01/01 - 2024/06/21  
Data: [flipside](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz)  
Public Dashboard: https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/zanglang/relayer-dao-6OJ04V  

- Total transactions using the feegrant: 2,356,157
- Total packets relayed using the feegrant: 6,948,644
- Total grantees: 26
- Total unique paths relayed: 198
- Total misbehaving transactions: 4 (all tests)
- Total ATOM spent: 8000*

*The initial 8000 ATOM budget was set to last for 3 months as per [Cosmoshub proposal 862](https://www.mintscan.io/cosmos/proposals/862). IBC Relayers on the Cosmoshub have applied optimized batching settings, which efficiently lead to an extended service period of a total of 6 months. 

As the initial grant has now depleted, the Cosmoshub Relayer Feegrant Workinggroup is now seeking to request another batch of intermediary tx fee compensation in form of a grant from the [Atom Accelerator DAO](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xDrPdqDh6bZvoSS2s3VPlWfvTvVjALBY2Ds10eCNkL8/edit?gid=0#gid=0).
